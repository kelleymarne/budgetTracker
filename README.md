## Description

> Challenge #19 Budget Tracker PWA

## Introduction 
This week we were given starter code for a budget tracker and add offline functionality to be able to track your expenses in real time even with unstable internet connections, and be able to have the app fully updated when you go back online.

## Challenges

For the most part this wasnt too difficult to get set up. Luckily with this assignment alot like the other assingments we've done lately it is a lot of boiler plate code tha will have slight changes here and there.

## Victories

I was acutally able to pump this out quicker than i expected. I did take a question to my tutor about an error i was getting about he POST route when offline, i thought something was broken but it actually turned out that the error was supposed to be occuring while we are offline, and that i had in fact gotten it set up correctly by myself. Its exciting to see myself need less and less help with the challenges as we go.
